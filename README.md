I wasworking on this project in Atom from begining taking as a first example https://joel.sh/ cv
I was adding the pages Bio Contact Cv and Index with not too much in 
I was starting looking for models and I set up the ideas and I started to work 
The css was created first for the home page ,after I finished with the home page I was just going and copy paste the header and footer and add images and another features specific to the pages 

I tried to do it simple and clear and double check with the requirements

I hope I touched all the points
