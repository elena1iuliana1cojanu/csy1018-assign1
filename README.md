I was working on this project in Atom from begin taking as a first example https://joel.sh/cv ..after I started to work in Sublime Text and push some work in GitHub when I had almost all the assignment .
I was adding the pages Bio Contact Cv and Index .
I was starting looking for models and I set up the ideas and I started to work .
The css was created first for the home page, after I finished with the home page I was just going and copy paste the header and footer and add images and another features specific to the pages .
Alt tags are present for all images. Structural layout includes header, footer, and nav. There are no frameworks or JavaScript files added. The code is very well commented in both the HTML and CSS. Structure and presentation are separate.
I used folders for :
o	csy1018-assign1/		    - All html files (.html)
o	csy1018-assign1/images	    -  All website image files (.gif .jpg)
o	csy1018-assign1/css		    -  All css files (.css)
o   csy1018-assign1/README      -  Read me file

 

I tried to do it simple and clear and double check with the requirements

I hope I touched all the points
